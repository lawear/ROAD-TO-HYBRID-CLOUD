### Project: Virtualized AD-DS Laboratory Environment
## Version: 1.0

#### Focus: Windows Server 2022, Network Infrastructure, and Client Integration

**Summary**
This project outlines the design and deployment of a virtualized Active Directory Domain Services (AD-DS) environment. The architecture utilizes a Windows Server 2022 Domain Controller (DC) configured as a multihomed gateway. It provides DNS, DHCP, and NAT Routing services, bridging an external VMware NAT interface to an isolated internal LAN segment for secure client connectivity.


**Lab Overview**

| Component | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Hypervisor** | VMware Workstation |
| **Operating Systems** | Windows Server 2022, Windows 11 |
| **Virtual Machines** | 2 (Domain Controller & Client) |
| **VM Resources** | 2 CPUs, 4 GB RAM, 30 GB HDD each |

### Setup Steps:
**INSTALL ACTIVE DIRECTORY & PROMOTE TO DC**
-Select “Add Roles and Features” from Server Manager Dashboard.

-Run through the installation wizard leaving “Role-based or feature-based” selected.

-Select Server(DC_NY)

-Select Active Directory Domain Services,DNS Server,DHCP Server and Remote Access.





**Confirm Selections and Install**

### Configuring a DHCP Scope
The DHCP service automates the assignment of IP addresses, subnet masks, and other network parameters to client machines. To initialize this service, an administrator must define a Scope—a consecutive range of possible IP addresses for a network.

Initialization: Within the Server Manager, navigate to Tools > DHCP. In the management console, right-click IPv4 and initiate the New Scope Wizard.

Identification: Assign a logical Name and Description to the scope to ensure administrative clarity within the directory.

Address Range and Subnetting: Define the pool of available IP addresses by entering the Start and End IP addresses. The CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) notation and Subnet Mask must be configured here to define the boundaries of the local broadcast domain.

Lease Duration: By default, the system sets a Lease Duration (the lifespan of an assigned IP address before it must be renewed) of 8 days.

Scope Options (Gateway and DNS): * Default Gateway: Enter the IP address of the Domain Controller (DC). In this specific architecture, the DC serves as the gateway due to its NAT routing configuration.

DNS Server: Specify the DC’s IP address. This is a critical step; without pointing to the local DNS, client machines will fail to authenticate or resolve the domain name.

Activation: Skip the WINS Server configuration, confirm the activation of the scope, and finalize the wizard.

### Establishing a NAT Gateway
Network Address Translation (NAT) allows multiple devices on a private local network to access the internet using a single public IP address. This is managed through the Routing and Remote Access (RRAS) role.

Accessing RRAS: From the Server Manager, select Tools > Routing and Remote Access.

Server Configuration: Right-click the server node and select Configure and Enable Routing and Remote Access.

Role Selection: Choose Network Address Translation (NAT) from the list of deployment options.

Interface Mapping: Select the External/Public Network Interface Card (NIC). This is the interface that connects to the internet service provider or the external network.

Completion: Finalize the setup to enable the routing of traffic from the internal private network to the external public network.

## 🧩 Active Directory Setup

### 5️⃣ Install and Configure AD DS (PowerShell)
On the **DC VM**, open PowerShell as Administrator:

```powershell
# Install ADDS Role
Install-WindowsFeature AD-Domain-Services -IncludeManagementTools

# Configure new forest
Install-ADDSForest -DomainName "homelab.local"

Reboot after promotion and log in as the new Domain Admin.

📸 Screenshot Placeholder:

#Add Users via PowerShell

Example command to create a test user:

New-ADUser -Name "John Doe" `
-AccountPassword (ConvertTo-SecureString "P@ssword123" -AsPlainText -Force) `
-Enabled $true

📸 Screenshot Placeholder:
![Add AD User](./screenshots/add-user.png)

💻 Join Windows 11 Client to Domain

Change the client’s DNS to the DC’s Host-Only IP (e.g. 192.168.56.10).

Go to:

Settings → System → About → Rename this PC (Advanced)


Enter the domain name:

homelab.local


Provide domain credentials to join.

📸 Screenshot Placeholder:

After restart, log in using the domain account.

cmd:whoami
